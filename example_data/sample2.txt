If you’re using lots of annotators, CoreNLP can easily spend 10–40 seconds just loading an annotation pipeline. Pipeline loading time can easily dominate actual annotation time. So, if you load a new pipeline frequently, such as for every sentence, then CoreNLP will be painfully slow. You should load an annotation pipleline – what you get when you call new StanfordCoreNLP(props) in code – as infrequently as possible.
